    "**The following insights are expected from this project:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Department wise performances.\n",
    "* Top 3 Important Factors effecting employee performance.\n",
    "* A trained model which can predict the employee performance based on factors as inputs. This will be used to hire employees\n",
    "* Recommendations to improve the employee performance based on insights from analysis.\n",

    "The given Employee dataset is supervised and categorical. dataset consist of 1200 rows. Total 28 feature(columna) in the data. The shape of the dataset is 1200x28. The 28 features are classified into quantitative and qualitative where 19 features are quantitative (11 columns consists numeric data & 8 columns consists ordinal data) and 8 features are qualitative.The target variable 'Performance Rating' is ordinal.\n",
    "\n",
    "From Correlation we can get the important aspects of the data, Correlation between features and Performance Rating.Correlation is a statistical measure that expresses the extent to which two variables are linearly related.The analysis of the project has gone through the stage of Univariate,Bivariate & Multivariate analysis, correlation analysis and analysis by each department to satisfy the project goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of Categorical data and Numerical data. The Target variable consist of ordinal data, so this is a classification problem.The multiple machine learning model used in this project  like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest,  K-Nearest Neighbor, XGBoost Classifier and Artificial Neural Network to calculate the accuracy and found out that XGBoost Classifier gives the maximum accuracy of 95%.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the important goal of this project is to find the important feature affecting the performance rating. The important features were predicted using the machine learning model feature importance technique. The main technique used in the preprocessing data using the Mannual encoding method to convert the categorical data into numerical data, because, Most of machine learning methods are based on numerical methods where strings are not supportive. The overall project was performed and achieved the goals by using the machine learning model and visualization techniques.\n"
